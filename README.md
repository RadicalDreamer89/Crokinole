# Crokinole

Crokinole is a traditional tabletop game, similar to Shuffleboard, or everyone's favorite sport to mock, Curling.

Rules:

There are two teams, the Purple team, and the Gold team.  Each team is alloted 12 pucks.  If there are no pucks of the opposing color on the board, the player whose turn it is should aim to land their puck at least inside the second largest ring (the one surrounded by the bumpers).  If there are pucks of the opposing color on the board, you must make contact with the opposing puck.  If you knock your opponent's puck outside of the outermost ring, that puck is removed from play.  Be careful:  this also applies to your own pucks!

How To Play:

You may adjust the position of your puck with the left and right arrow keys.  To aim and launch, click on your puck and drag it in the desired direction.  The farther you drag the puck, the more velocity it will launch with.

Scoring:

Each of the rings is worth differing point values.  Pucks that are inside of the largest, outermost ring are worth 5 points.  Pucks inside the middle ring are worth 10 points.  Pucks inside the center ring are worth 15 points.  Pucks that land precisely inside of the smallest, innermost ring are worth 20 points and are removed from play.  Scoring is calculated at the end of each round, once the last puck has been launched.
